## Application Stacks

Application stacks enable rapid development of quality microservice-based applications. Stacks include a pre-configured container based development environment and project templates, which provide the language runtimes, frameworks, and any additional libraries and tools that you need for local development. Stacks are an easy way to manage consistency and adopt best practices across many applications.
